## Level Persistence & Sharing

### Auto-Save in Browser  
- Edits (painting, adding/removing levels, property changes) are saved automatically to `localStorage`.  
- On page load, your last session is restored—no extra clicks needed.

### Export/Import JSON  
- **Save All Levels** downloads a `levels.json` file containing every level.  
- **Load All Levels** lets you pick a `.json` file to import—levels overwrite your current work and become your new auto-save.

### Shareable & Bookmarkable URLs  
- Your entire level set is compressed (via LZ-String) and encoded into the URL hash.  
- As you edit, the URL updates in real-time—copy/paste to share your exact levels!  
- Opening someone’s link decodes the hash and loads their levels instantly, no file download required.

### Online Levels
- You can publish levels and share them using an unique name.
- Once your level is published, you can share that name and other players with that name will be able to load it using the Load Shared Level Button.
- Or you can find it in the level browser.

## Modding Guide

### Overview

This game provides an API and a system of hooks that allow you to extend and customize gameplay behavior. Mods can respond to in-game events, modify player state, or add new mechanics without changing the core game code.

### Hooks

Hooks are functions that the game engine calls at specific points during gameplay. You can register your own functions to these hooks via the `SystematicAPI.on` method.

Common hooks include:

* **`onUpdate(player, keys)`**
  Called every frame during the game update. Provides access to the current player object and the state of input keys.

* **`onPlayerJump(player)`**
  Called when the player performs a jump, returns player attributes like x, y, vx, vy, height, width, etc
  
* **`onPlayerTouchGround(player)`**
  Called when the player lands on the ground, returns player attributes like x, y, vx, vy, height, width, etc

* **`onPlayerTouchWallRight(player, tileX, tileY, layer)`**
  Called when the player touches a wall on the right, returns player attributes like x, y, vx, vy, height, width, etc, and where the event happened (tx,ty,layer).

* **`onPlayerTouchWallLeft(player, tileX, tileY, layer)`**
  Called when the player touches a wall on the left, returns player attributes like x, y, vx, vy, height, width, etc, and where the event happened (tx,ty,layer).

* **`onPlayerBounce(player, tileX, tileY, layer)`**
  Called when the player bounces on a spring, returns player attributes like x, y, vx, vy, height, width, etc, and where the event happened (tx,ty,layer).

* **`onKeyDown(key)`**
  Called when a key is pressed, returns the key pressed.


### Player Object

The player object includes properties such as:

* `x`, `y`: Position coordinates.
* `vx`, `vy`: Velocity components.
* `width`, `height`: Size dimensions.
* `onGround`: Boolean indicating whether the player is on the ground.
* Custom properties can be added as needed for your mod.

### Example: Adding Double Jump

Below is a simplified example of adding double jump functionality using hooks:

```js
const DOUBLE_JUMP_DELAY = 250;
const jumpPower = -10

// Reset jump count & record time on first jump
SystematicAPI.on("onPlayerJump", (player) => {
  player._jumpCount      = 1;                    // used one jump
  player._lastJumpTime   = performance.now();    // record when it happened
});

// Reset on landing
SystematicAPI.on("onPlayerTouchGround", (player) => {
  player._jumpCount      = 0;
  player._lastJumpTime   = 0;
  player._doubleJumpKeyDown = false;
});

// Watch every frame for the double‐jump key, but enforce delay
SystematicAPI.on("onUpdate", (player, keys) => {
  const now = performance.now();
  const canDoubleJump =
    !player.onGround &&                               // in air
    (player._jumpCount || 0) === 1 &&                 // used exactly one jump
    (now - (player._lastJumpTime || 0)) >= DOUBLE_JUMP_DELAY;

  if ((keys["w"] || keys["ArrowUp"])  &&               // jump key
      canDoubleJump &&                                 // delay passed
      !player._doubleJumpKeyDown) {                    // debounce
    // PERFORM DOUBLE JUMP:
    player.vy               = jumpPower;
    player._jumpCount      += 1;
    player._lastJumpTime    = now;                     // update time
    player._doubleJumpKeyDown = true;

    // Optional double‐jump hook & effects
    SystematicAPI.trigger("onPlayerDoubleJump", player);
  }

  // Reset debounce when key is released
  if (!(keys["w"] || keys["ArrowUp"])) {
    player._doubleJumpKeyDown = false;
  }
});
```

### Triggering Custom Events

You can also trigger your own events using:

```js
SystematicAPI.trigger('eventName', ...args);
```

For example, trigger a custom event when the player performs a double jump:

```js
SystematicAPI.trigger('onPlayerDoubleJump', player);
```

This structure allows modders to add new gameplay mechanics, input handling, and interactions by registering functions to hooks and using the API to modify the player state or trigger events.
