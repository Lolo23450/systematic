## Level Persistence & Sharing

### Auto-Save in Browser  
- Edits (painting, adding/removing levels, property changes) are saved automatically to `localStorage`.  
- On page load, your last session is restored‚Äîno extra clicks needed.

### Export/Import JSON  
- **Save All Levels** downloads a `levels.json` file containing every level.  
- **Load All Levels** lets you pick a `.json` file to import‚Äîlevels overwrite your current work and become your new auto-save.

### Shareable & Bookmarkable URLs  
- Your entire level set is compressed (via LZ-String) and encoded into the URL hash.  
- As you edit, the URL updates in real-time‚Äîcopy/paste to share your exact levels!  
- Opening someone‚Äôs link decodes the hash and loads their levels instantly, no file download required.

### Online Levels
- You can publish levels and share them using an unique name.
- Once your level is published, you can share that name and other players with that name will be able to load it using the Load Shared Level Button.
- Or you can find it in the level browser.
